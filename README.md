TarHeelGallery
==============

Tarheel Gallery is a website that brings together the fundamentals of HTML5, PHP, Javascript/JQuery, MySQL, Ajax cals, and RESTful interfaces. This website was built for the final project of my Advanced Web Programming course. The basis of Tarheel Gallery was to create a website which we were perferred to not use any kinds of frameworks or plugins.
